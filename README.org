* Objective
Use LLMs as an integral part of the software development process. Initital objective is to create an Emacs package which talks with the OpenAI API.

We can accomplish things like:
1. Document code
2. Explain the code
3. Write tests for the code
4. Optimize the code
* Example
This code defines a emacs lisp function which gets selected text and opens it in a new buffer.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun ai-llm/get-selected-text ()
  "Open selected text into a new buffer"
  (interactive)
  (setq str (buffer-substring (mark) (point)))
  (setq buffer-name (generate-new-buffer "foo"))
  (switch-to-buffer buffer-name)
  (insert str))
#+end_src

The next step would be to send this text to a Python script which in turn sends it to OpenAI API and receives the response.
* Python script
This receives text on standard input, sends it off to the OpenAI API and prints out the result.
